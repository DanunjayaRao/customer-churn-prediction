# customer-churn-prediction
End-to-end customer churn prediction using ML &amp; DL with EDA, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction  

This project predicts whether a customer will **churn (leave the company)** or **stay**, based on their demographics, services, and account information.  
It applies **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, **feature engineering**, and both **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** models to compare performance.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Deep Learning Model: Sequential Neural Network  
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
- Comparison of ML vs DL performance  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML models & preprocessing)  
- **XGBoost**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (Deep Learning model)  
- **Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)**
